Todo list 10/24/16

1. Add testBill class, to test the Bill class    (Crosby-Done)
2. Add testTransaction class, to test the transaction class (Brad-DONE)
3. Finish implementing the test function for toJSON for ALL model classes (DONE)
4. Removed redundant code among the classes (Rudy-Done)
(these are key, but hard)
5. Start researching how to implementing a servlet that accepts files (to update a "check")
6. Start researching how to implement a servlet that returns a file to download(to print a check)
7. Impliment front-end Withdraw/Deposit once above steps are done

8. Update these functions:
    - Transfer (Account, Account, amount)// I know we have something like this, is it ready?
    - Deposit (Account, amount) // update it to accept objects?
    - Withdraw (Account, amount)  //update it to accept objects?
    - Pay Bill (Bill) //need this

minor changes:
1. Change the Date string, to a Date Object.
2. figure out how to escape any SQL code via a private function in the databaseInterface
    can be called sanitizeInput()
3. Change ALL amount variables in transactions to ints. Make sure this is handle properly.


Other changes nitpick:
(I think doing these changes can break a lot of things if we aren't careful)
1. Why are there two constructors for the Transaction class?
2. Verify the Date Object is used to create dates for Bills/Transactions. But after that they are strings,
    as it makes no sense to be able to change these aspects of the classes once created.
